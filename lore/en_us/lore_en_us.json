I, Roger Henry Stevens, lead this expedition, and am accompanied by two strong associates: Walter McKay and Elias Anders. As leader, I assign myself the task of documenting our journey for posterity, as well as recording all scientific measurements and observations to be gained from this endeavor.\\n\\nAs draft animals are difficult to come by, our expedition is lightly equipped, bearing only what we may carry on our backs. Our goal is to complete a circumference of the outer obelisks and, if successful, gather a full expedition to penetrate ruins and make a true inspection of the central obelisk. One planned detour is to be made to the Windsward settlement for resupply and respite.\\n\\nI plan to spend a few days at each obelisk, taking measurements and gathering plant and stone samples from each location, to determine what \u2014 if any \u2014 differences are present at each. Our first destination is the Orion obelisk, where the journey shall begin."

A pleasant change from these past weeks, having a roof over our head. I shall have to speak with McKay and Anders and ensure we do not relax our guard, even during this respite. I am confident that my idea of leaving collected samples at staged locations is the correct one, given our limited carrying space.\\n\\nTo note: Samples have been stored at the Hydrus obelisk, while the first bundle of notes were stored at the Draco obelisk. Collect these upon our return.\\n\\nStructure is almost identical to others found on previous expeditions, save some environmental weathering. This morning, McKay tied off a rope and climbed to the observation platform, with nothing to show for it but a nice view. Stones appear to have been shaped with little or no use of tools, may have been magically crafted. Will continue to investigate area, but plan to move on to Delphinus soon."

No damage is apparent, no major alteration in construction... though neither has easy access to the upper balcony. Is there something on that level which attracts the Guardians? I shall convince McKay to scale the side to the platform to inspect the area further.\\n\\nWe shall continue our endeavor, and with luck, will find a clue to help us unlock the mysteries of these obelisks."

These questions were not unusual, but the tone she spoke of them was more akin to an accusation.\\n\\nI asked her what had become of her ship, and the Santiago, but she confessed she knew nothing of the Santiago and had not sought it out\u2026 and I realized she had not sought our ship out, either. I took in the health and disposition of her crew, and that made me even more uncomfortable. Many looked gaunt, starved, and were exhausted from what must have been a march of many days with little rest\u2026 but their expressions told of greater unpleasantness. Even old friends among the crew seemed unwilling to speak to us.\\n\\nIt seems few of Isabella's crew survived to reach Aeternum's shores. We have offered to share our bounty and food with them, for I realize we have had better success with hunting than it seems they have had.\\n\\nChief Pilot Keyes of the San Crist\u00f3bal"

They put everyone around them in danger. An old Soulwarden like me lives in fear of that every day. \\n\\nI can't bear the thought of hurting you, and wrecking what we've built together. I thought of slipping away quietly a dozen times. But I just couldn't bear to leave. That hope you showed me... the courage, and the leadership... that was my weakness. \\n\\nI never thought I'd be part of something like this again. These last months, rebuilding the Soulwardens, I've been the happiest I can remember ever being.

Fish found in salt waters around the world can be found here, and the same applies to fresh water fish.\\n\\nFinally, fishing in Aeternum is different because it's just more exciting!

If my translation is correct, the Ancients had control over powers far beyond what we could ever imagine: the soul itself. This device supposedly has the ability to shape and manipulate the soul, even stealing it from the living! What would happen to a person if their soul were ripped away, leaving only the savage husk behind? We have seen those mindless, shambling creatures across the island... perhaps this explains their plight.\\nI do not believe that this device was intended to be a weapon, however deadly it might be. There are gaps in the tablets we've found, but I think this device could have been used as a restorative of some kind, wrapping the soul in azoth, to heal or to grant great power.\\nIf it were stronger, I would destroy this device before it could ever be used again... but more must be learned about it before that decision is made.\\nD.

Even just shifting the rocks near it draws their attention, but I've gotten close enough to get an idea of its size. Unwieldy, but nothing I haven't dealt with before.\\nAnd finally... a working Ancient device! I've no idea what it does, but it is tucked away on the lower level. When I touched it, flames erupted from the device and I was barely able to escape before a crowd of those Guardians approached. It seemed to draw them away from the upper level... perhaps I can use this."

This travel seems cyclical in nature, with a new group arriving every few months. Pliny the Elder wrote of elephants, reporting that they would ritually bathe each other to celebrate the new moon. Mayhap this rite is like that of the elephants, guided by a measure unknown to us?\\nBut what drives this slow Promenade toward Reekwater? Is it some form of pilgrimage? Or is there something else to it? I've attempted to find evidence that Dryads leave this place to travel elsewhere, and have yet to find any evidence of that. And as Reekwater is not overrun with Dryads in every nook, the only theory remaining is further proof of their level of intelligence: a knowledge of death, and a desire to do so in a designated place.\\nBut death holds almost no power here on Aeternum. What, then, is the purpose?"

Given that they have no organs we can identify, being made of stone and branch and vine, perhaps they have no need. But this does not mean they are unaware of the concept of construction.\\nOne construction draws the attention of Dryads more than any other, and these places are where the highest populations can be found: ruins of the Ancients. Their vines twist through the stones, slowly breaking apart that which has weathered time and storm and events unimaginable. Some travelers have even mentioned seeing Dryads use their weapons in an attempt to break the Ancient stones.\\nBut why? What motivates this behavior? They do not dismantle our villages, or seek out our hideaways. If they were human, I would propose that they seek to destroy all evidence of the Ancients, much as Scipio Africanus set his torch to Carthage. Events in the past, long before our reckoning, may have caused this enmity. We may never know the full story, but we must seek to find all we can."

I reminded him of the great fields of life that blossomed around the obelisks \u2013 if that was their power while the obelisks slept, what life might rise should they awake and how could that be naught but a good thing? Do we ourselves not awake each day and are better than when we sleep and know nothing but dreams?\\n\\nEven my reasoned arguments did not quell the man's doubt. He became quite animated, saying I knew not what might wake at the center Spire... even the dead, the skeletons that encircled the cursed temple might come alive, if their hearts were tied to this land.\\n\\nI suspect our ways must soon part, though I know his promise of payment keeps him in my shadow for now. If needs must, I will send him away, but before he goes, I will need his azoth for what I plan next. I will unlock the mysteries here, and cast such a light that it will burn away doubts and shadow from fearful minds.\\n\\n-Grenville"

He spoke of nameless dangers if I persisted in my efforts, until I grew quite tired of it, and told him I wished to hear no more.\\n\\nAt this point, I ordered him to part with the azoth one last time.

Wyrdwood trees are rare, and tend to grow in dangerous and Lawless Areas, but the Wyrdwood they provide is required for the highest Tiers of items. The Logging and Carpentry Trade Skill improves how much you gather from each tree, grants a chance to receive higher Rarity Wood, and allows refining the Wood.\\n\\nA Pickaxe or Pick is used to gather stone from Boulders and ore from metal veins like Iron Veins. Boulders are common, but are found most densely in Highlands areas. Ore Veins are less common, and are also most likely to be found in Highlands areas. You can use the Map to identify Highlands areas to search. Starmetal and Orichalcum are rare metals that only appear in dangerous and Lawless Areas. They are required for the highest recipe Tiers. The Mining, Stonecutting, and Smelting Trade Skill helps you gather more from Boulders and Ore Veins, grant a chance to gather higher Rarity resources, and allows you to refine those resources.\\n\\nA Sickle is used to harvest various plants, both mundane and alchemical. Throughout Aeternum, plants like Hemp, Vegetables, Herbs, and Alchemical Ingredients can be found growing in the wild. Hemp provides Fibers, which are important to creating cloth and clothing. Vegetables and Herbs are used in many Provisioning recipes to create meals, and can be grown by Companies in their owned Territories. Alchemical Ingredients are unique to Aeternum, and provide the power needed to create Potions and Magical Gauntlets. The Harvesting and Weaving Trade Skill lets you gather more from plants, gives you a chance to gather higher Rarities of resources from plants, and allows you to weave Fibers into cloth.\\n\\nA Skinning Knife is used to cut Rawhide from dead animals, and to collect their Meat. Many types of wildlife can be found across Aeternum. Most allow the harvesting of Rawhide, but some species like Elk have a chance of providing Animal Horn, and others like Wolves could provide Animal Fangs. Explore to find the types of areas each species prefers. The Tracking, Skinning, and Tanning Trade Skill lets you harvest more resources from animals, gives you a chance to harvest higher Rarities of those resources, allows you to tan Rawhide into leather, and gives you the ability to track animals on your Compass at the top of the screen."

During this phase, the Companies still may not attack each other without commiting a crime. This phase grants the Defending Company the opportunity to muster their forces, and prevents surprise attacks while most of a Company's members are offline.\\n\\nAfter the Pre-War phase comes the Battle phase. During this phase, the involved Companies can attack each other freely without any criminal punishment. Territory protections are active, however. The length of the Battle phase can vary depending on when the War was started and what time the Defender's Siege Window is set for.\\n\\nThe next phase is Siege. The Siege phase takes place during the Defending Company's Siege Window. During this phase, the Attacking Company can bypass the Defending Company's protection on their Territories. This means the attacker can destroy one of the Defender's Protection Wards even if they've paid for protection. This phase ends early if a Protection Ward is successfully destroyed.\\n\\nAfter the Siege phase, the War enters a Resolution phase. The Companies can still attack each other during this phase just like during the Battle phase. However, during this phase the Defending Company can declare a counter attack. This is a special way of declaring War that costs less than the initial attack and skips the Pre-War phase. Instead, a counter attack's Battle phase starts immediately after the Resolution phase ends.

There are a variety of weapons to choose from, each with its own nuances, but they fall into two broad categories: melee and ranged.\\n\\nMelee weapons are used up close. These are things like swords, spears, clubs, and battleaxes. Each melee weapon has 3 attacks:\\n  \u2022 Standard Attack ([LMB]): the base attack for the weapon, and the one you'll likely use most often\\n  \u2022 Heavy Attack ([F]): a slow, high damage attack that makes use of GRIT and can break through blocks\\n  \u2022 Special Attack ([Q]): this varies by weapon, and costs Mana instead of Stamina to use. For example, using this with a sword does a quick slash and stab combo, but using this with a spear switches to a throwing mode allowing you to use the spear as a ranged weapon\\n  \u2022 Sprinting Attack ([SHIFT] + [LMB]): lunges forward during the attack and deals good damage, but can cost a lot of Stamina\\n\\nYou can also equip a shield with any one-handed melee weapon. Shields offer much better Blocking Absorption than a weapon alone, but also replace the Special Attack with a quick but low damage shield bash.\\n\\nThe damage you do with a melee weapon scales with different Attributes depending on the weapon. Most commonly this is Strength.\\n\\nRanged weapons are the opposite of melee weapons. They are best used at a distance, and don't offer different attacks. While wielding a ranged weapons, aim it by holding [RMB] and then fire by clicking [LMB]. Clicking [LMB] without aiming will swing the weapon, hopefully clearing you enough space to fire again or retreat.\\n\\nFirearms like muskets fire their round very quickly, so you don't have to judge travel time to the target. However, they take time to reload.\\n\\nBows suffer from the arrow traveling more slowly, and it will drop as gravity affects it. They can fire more quickly than firearms, though.\\n\\nThe damage you deal with ranged weapons scales with your Dexterity Attribute."

Avoiding or limiting damage can give you the advantage you need to swing a close fight in your favor. There are two main ways to defend: dodging and blocking.\\n\\nDodging can cost a lot of Stamina, but if done well it prevents all damage simply because you aren't hit. You can dodge at any time by pressing [SPACE] to roll. Holding a direction ([W], [A], [S], or [D]) when you press [SPACE] will cause you to roll in that direction, allowing you to not only avoid the attack but end your dodge in an advantageous position.\\n\\nDodging is not without risk, though. If you fail in your timing or direction, you will be hit just as hard as if you'd done nothing, and you will still have spent the Stamina. Masterful dodging can win a fight, but poor dodging can lose one.\\n\\nBlocking is much easier, but doesn't prevent all damage. With a melee weapon equipped, you can hold [RMB] to block attacks from in front of you. While blocking, you decrease the damage the attack does by a large percentage, which depends on the weapon or shield you're using. You also spend some Stamina. However, the risk is much lower than dodging, and you hold your ground. Be careful to avoid heavy attacks, though, as these may break through your block and deal full damage.\\n\\nEquipping a shield gives you the best possible blocking absorption.

The man \u2013 no doubt regretting his unintended challenge \u2013 said he had seen it on the Eastern edge of Brightwood, but curiously, it had not always been there \u2013 it had risen from the earth not long after the Night of Blue Lanterns.
